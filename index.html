        <p>The page contains samples generated on held out test sets using a PyTorch implementation of waveRNN based neural vocoder, which predicts a raw waveform from a mel-spectrogram.<br>
        The code to train the model can be found at the following link <a href="https://github.com/anandaswarup/waveRNN/">https://github.com/anandaswarup/waveRNN/</a>
