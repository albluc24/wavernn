# Recurrent Neural Network based Neural Vocoders

PyTorch implementation of waveRNN vocoder, which predicts a raw waveform from a mel-spectrogram. 

## Getting started

### Configuration

Configuration parameters / hyperparameters are specified in `config.py`, and these values are used across all scripts.
